# Allied
## USA

  
The USA deploys advanced technology that focuses on precise but powerful strikes, most notably seen in their airforce and missile systems. Being part of the Allied Forces they also utilise experimental technology derived from Einstein's research; such as all new sonic emitters and high powered laser systems capable of taking down enemy missiles.

## JAPAN

The Japenese specialize in advanced robotics such as their dual mode Tengu Jets as well as weather manipulation, deploying weather towers anywhere on the battlefield. Their scientists have branched Chrono technology into an entirely new class: Cryogenics.  
Their focus is disrupting enemies with powerful area damage and slow effects.

# Soviet
## RUSSIA

  
The head of the communist nations, wildly regarded for the creation of the feared Apocalypse tank divisions and their use of Tesla weaponry, employing its destructive nature in various experimental and conventional weapon systems.   
  
Their dependence on this breakthrough technology has allowed them to create early stages of global EMP blackout systems, armoured Tesla-Raider super soldiers, experimental versions of a Tesla Tank, and enhancing modern weapons and vehicles to instil their destructive feat.

## IRAQ

  
The Iraqi armies are the most ill-conventional of the communist nations. Their tactics apply a high degree of multitool units and ranged attacks, as well as using the most vicious radiation weapon systems available.  
  
With the help of the Russians, vehicles like the Hammer Tank and Siege Chopper allow quick strikes on high value targets, being able to convert into different weapons systems to thwart enemy responses in battle. Modern tanks can be infused with nuclear engines, enhancing both speed and destructibility. If all fails, units like the Demolition truck and Desolator, or nuclear ballistic missiles are called to turn the tide of the battle. If ground cannot be won, a wasteland will take its place.

## UKRAINE

  
Albeit much smaller than the Supreme Soviet Russia, the groundwork for the creation of robotics units, such as the Terror Drone, and the refined Iron Curtain technology is accredited to Ukraine science teams. Ever since the Chernobyl disaster in 1984, the Ukraine government experimented with various ways for its armies to navigate through radiation invested zones.  
  
The creation of the Terror Drone, now replaced by the Iron Strider, with even more automated weapon platforms, solved this problem entirely. To allow vehicles through these zones unharmed, Iron Curtain, and now more experimentally “Iron Nova” barriers were created. The defensive tactics that Ukraine armies uphold both frustrate and humiliate enemy commanders that dare attack its borders.

# Yuri

## PSICORPS

  
The backbone of the Soviet Union’s once powerful physic legacy, now returned to our rightful leader Yuri.  
  
We operate using mind manipulation and unorthodox weaponry. Yuri’s will has allowed us to create flying mechanical hive minds to steal the will of minds from the air. Perfected Yuri clones can be martyred for enemy units, stealing their minds, enhancing their strength and firepower for our benefit, permanently. Our vehicles have the power to link their minds together, combined strength to destroy any army that dares opposes us. We have many more tricks up our sleeve, all will be revealed in time.   
  
  
After all, your will is Yuri’s will.

## SPECTER

  
The masters of stealth technology, creating new weapons of war and enhancing conventional units.  
  
Newly formed Specter teams allow experienced squads to appear from the air, using a stealthy landing to demolish enemy structures and eliminate infantry with ease. Newly created Stealth Tanks are the ultimate hit and run unit, a small group will make short work of any unsuspecting tank column or undefended building.  
  
Some basic infantry and vehicles may also be equipped with stealth, further enhancing their efficiency on the battlefield. With the power to cloak bases and armies, commanders will need to think twice about their actions, and if they are truly safe as they think they are.

## GENESIS

  
Experimenting on various subjects, using mind-controlled slaves and willing fanatics to further Genesis's cause.  
Their research has led to many instances of forces attaining a new “evolution”, as they would call it, and even weaponizing forms of devolution on their enemies. Watch as your enemies turn into the mindless monkey ancestors they once were or turn into enraged brutes to reap havoc on the battlefield. Commanders can heal their units instantly in battle, DNA splice their units for enhanced abilities, and prototype developments of new subterranean vehicles to hit armies in unsuspecting areas.  
  
Due to the notoriety of Genesis’ brutality, enemy commanders will often commit suicide to prevent capture and experimentation after losing a battle. You do not want to be another husk on the battlefield.

# APA

## CHINA

  
The leading nation for the Asian Pacific Alliance (APA), using nothing but conventional warfare to over run their enemies.  
  
Their leading advances include the devastating use of flame weaponry, attached to infantry units, artillery, and fighter jets alike. If enemy commanders last long enough, they may be greeted by China’s new Shenlong tank, a heavy flamethrower on treads.  
  
China’s military doctrine promotes a strong pride for its military and nation, which can be improved with repeated bouts of nationalism. This encourages infantry armies to gain increased proficiencies and fight harder on the battlefield. Commanders who fight against these armies will need to be quick and decisive with their actions. The longer the fight goes on, the stronger the Chinese armies become.

## NORTH KOREA

  
With the help of the Chinese and their resources, the North Korean’s were able to expand and pride themselves on technology advancements, improving survivability and effectivity on the battlefield.  
  
Such advancements include the beginning stages of railgun tanks, piercing multiple vehicles with every shot and reducing their ability to fight back. Minigunners replace common rifle infantry, mowing down aircraft with ease as they fly over them.  
  
EMP tech is commonplace among their armies, either granting EMP missiles to Tank Hunter squads, or calling in specialized bombers to immobilize an entire army.   
  
Commanders that group their armies together will often find difficulties facing the North Koreans, so a good amount of micromanagement is needed to keep your army in one piece.

## VIETNAM

  
Prior to China’s control of Vietnam, you would never see the Vietnamese operate in open battlefields. Their armies continue to use the elements to their advantage: any amount of forestry, unsavoury weather conditions, or tight and dangerous travel routes were used to bait armies to enter right into their traps and end them swiftly. Now, these tactics can be used in almost any element during a battle.  
  
Using the same tactics commonly used under jungle warfare, commanders that believed held the upper hand soon found their armies eliminated with ease.  
Snipers are the most efficient infantry unit the Vietnamese use, large groups on infantry eliminated with precision. Newly formed Disc throwers charge at tanks and throw their albeit small but heavy ordinance to halt vehicles. Mines are commonplace, unsuspecting or lone units often never return home to report their findings.  
  
Any smart commander knows to watch every angle in both their armies and bases, you never know what they’ll hit next.

# GLA 

## SCARAB CELL

  
The leading division of the infamous GLA.  
With its forces more commonly seen in frontline battles compared to other GLA cells. The Scarab Cell places a heavy emphasis on survivability and an adequate amount of modernization, to go toe to toe against enemy factions with a great technological superiority compared to the GLA’s crude armies.  
  
The GLA’s Scrap-masters introduced newly created Quad Tanks – upgrading the survivability of old Quad Cannons, Marauder MKII – adding a rotating turret for easier tracking of multiple targets, Scarab Rockets – adding extra firepower to Main Scarab Tanks, and the MOW – a new artillery piece capable of operating both deployed and undeployed.  
  
To combat fierce tank battalions, heavy ordnance trained insurgents are created to solely target vehicles and claim early victories for their armies, or an experienced pilot may be called to drop an unsuspected carpet bombing on the enemy.  
  
Enemy commanders who have repeated bouts with the Scarab Cell always learn to never underestimate old relics of the past.  

![](https://www.riseoftheeastmod.com/assets/img/scarab.png)

## SCORPION CELL

  
The most fanatical and extremist soldiers find a home amongst the Scorpion Cell armies, armed with a zealous mind and willing to sacrifice themselves for their homeland.  
You can thank their Chemists for the creation and addition of toxin weapons systems to the GLA arsenal. However, Dr Thrax, is notoriously responsible for the creation of Anthrax Gamma, a new potent strain of toxin to further their destructive power, used wildly by their Toxin Soldiers and Plague Spreaders, as well upgrading other units with toxin warheads.  
  
Other Chemists take themselves to the front line, nicknamed Street pharmacists. These brave medics wield highly potent healing properties to heal other soldiers immediately, and even add an unknown benefit, that not even they themselves fully understand yet.  
  
Take care when fighting these armies, as they will never surrender themselves, nor take any prisoners.  

![](https://www.riseoftheeastmod.com/assets/img/scorpion.png)

## COBRA CELL

  
Priding themselves with their highly used and effective guerrilla tactics and reliable use of putting any scrap they find to good use. You’ll often find the Cobra Cell responsible for various kidnappings, assassinations, insurgent rebellions, and various terrorist plots across the globe.  
  
Infiltrations and ambushes are made easy when facing their armies, with key structures or high value targets are eliminated with ease by summoning groups of insurgent forces in these areas.  
For a lack of head strong vehicles against larger tank forces, handmade EMP trucks were crafted to rush into enemy tank battalions and leave them stranded, easy targets for artillery forces.  
  
Masses of infantry can find themselves up against Rioter squads and Sandstorms artillery, forced to choose between Molotov cocktails on the ground or homing missiles from the air. Various contacts the GLA have made allow transport planes to drop supplies wherever needed, upgrading a certain number of vehicles with newly acquired equipment.  
  
When facing the Cobra Cell, always double check your base and be wary of ambushes, your forces may disappear as quickly as a blink of the eye.
